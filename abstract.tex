\begin{abstract}
Manual service flow and data management remained two of the most common challenges faced by many businesses and institutions, even in todayâ€™s digital age. One such institution was the University of the Philippines Visayas - Regional Research Center (RRC), which relied on manual and semi-automated processes, using Google Apps for their entire service delivery process. Although functional, this system was inefficient and limited the RRC's potential, posing challenges to both staff and clients. The main objective of this study was to develop a centralized system, aptly named TUKIB, to automate the service flow process and data management of the UPV RRC. Additionally, the study explored the development and integration of a chatbot using the Rasa framework. The project utilized an Agile methodology, focusing on iterative development and regular feedback loops to ensure the system met the evolving needs of the users. The developed system reduced manual tasks, improved data management, enhanced client support, and provided ease for both staff and clients, ultimately enhancing the overall operational efficiency of UPV RRC.

%From 150 to 200 words of short, direct and complete sentences, the abstract 
%should be informative enough to serve as a substitute for reading the entire SP document 
%itself.  It states the rationale and the objectives of the research.  
%In the final Special Problem  document (i.e., the document you'll submit for your final defense), the  abstract should also contain a description of your research results, findings,  and contribution(s).
