\begin{abstract}
Manual service flow and data management is still one of the challenges faced by many businesses and institutions, even in today’s digital age. One such institution is the UPV RRC, which currently relies on manual processes, using Google Apps for their entire service delivery process. Although functional, this system is inefficient and limits the center’s potential, posing challenges not only to the staff but to the clients as well. This proposal aims to develop TUKIB, a centralized system to automate the service flow process and data management of the UPV RRC. Additionally, this paper also explores the development and integration of a chatbot to enhance user support and interaction, as well as streamline communication with stakeholders. The proposed system aims to reduce manual tasks, improve data management, and provide ease for both staff and clients of UPV RRC, enhancing the overall operational efficiency of the institution.
