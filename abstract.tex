\begin{abstract}
Manual service flow and data management are still two of the most common challenges that are faced by many businesses and institutions, even in todayâ€™s digital age. One such institution is the University of the Philippines Visayas - Regional Research Center (RRC), which currently relies on manual and semi-automated processes, using Google Apps for their entire service delivery process. Although functional, this system is inefficient and limits the RRC's potential, posing challenges not only to the staff but to the clients as well. The main objective of this paper is to develop a centralized system, aptly named TUKIB, to automate the service flow process and data management of the UPV RRC. Additionally, this paper also aims to explore the development and integration of a chatbot using the Rasa framework. The proposed system aims to reduce manual tasks, improve data management, enhance client support, and provide ease for both staff and clients of UPV RRC, enhancing its overall operational efficiency.
