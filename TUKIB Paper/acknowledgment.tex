I would like to extend my gratitude everyone who has contributed their time, knowledge, and support toward the successful completion of this special problem. This journey would not have been possible without the help of many individuals who have motivated and inspired me along the way.

First and foremost, I am deeply grateful to my thesis adviser, Sir Francis Dimzon, for his invaluable guidance, patience, and insightful feedback, which have been significant throughout this project. His expert advice and support pushed me to explore unfamiliar technologies and tackle challenging tasks I had never attempted before. These experiences significantly broadened my skills and perspective, ultimately helping me grow both academically and personally.

I am also sincerely thankful to my special problem groupmates, Nang Sheryl and Kzlyr, for their dedication, collaboration, and hard work—not just during this project, but ever since our internship began. Your willingness to help one another, share responsibilities, and stay committed to our goals made this journey both manageable and meaningful.

I extend my gratitude to Ma’am Susci Ann Sobrevega and the staff of the Research Resource Center (RRC) for their generous assistance, expertise, and encouragement. Their practical insights and technical support greatly contributed to the development and refinement of the system presented in this work.
To my family, words cannot express my deepest appreciation for their unconditional love, understanding, and encouragement. Their constant faith in my abilities provided me with the strength and motivation to persevere, especially during difficult times. Their sacrifices and support have been the foundation of my academic journey.

I would also like to thank my friends—Kurt, John Luis, Chester, John Hamir, Jeff, Josaiah, Nong Jose, and the GD girls—who have been a source of joy, motivation, and encouragement. Their friendship, advice, and moments of laughter helped me maintain balance and stay positive throughout the demanding phases of this project.

To my special someone, Szophia, thank you for being my rock. Your unwavering support, comfort, and companionship have been invaluable. You have kept me grounded, encouraged me during moments of doubt, and even provided sustenance when I needed it most. You have truly been my study buddy and my greatest supporter.

Lastly, I am profoundly grateful to God for granting me good health, strength, and resilience throughout this journey. For the times when I felt overwhelmed, I found solace in prayer and faith, which helped me overcome challenges and remain hopeful.
